# BookingSync OAuth Helper

Small sinatra application to help you get your OAuth Token for your BookingSync Application.
This is specially useful to play around BookingSync API v3.

## Usage

### Requirements:

[POW](http://pow.cx/) - To run this Sinatra application.
[Tunnelss](https://github.com/rchampourlier/tunnelss) - To use SSL

_Note: Tricks for [persiting SSL with Tunnelss over reboot](http://www.sebgrosjean.com/en/news/2014/2/9/rails-with-ssl-in-development-with-pow-and-tunnels)_

### 1) Install dependencies

```sh
bundle install
```

### 2) Setup your BookingSync Application credentials

```sh
cp .powenv.sample .powenv
```

Edit the `BOOKINGSYNC_CLIENT_ID`, `BOOKINGSYNC_CLIENT_SECRET` and `BOOKINGSYNC_SCOPE` environment variables from the `.powenv` file.

### 3) Restart Pow

Make sure to restart Pow, using:

```sh
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

You can then use the [BookingSync API gem](https://github.com/BookingSync/bookingsync-api) to consume the API

Example in IRB console:

```ruby
require 'bookingsync-api'
require 'json'
api = BookingSync::API.new(YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN)
api.rentals.first.name
```
