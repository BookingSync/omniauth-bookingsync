# OmniAuth BookingSync

This is an OmniAuth 1.1 strategy for authenticating to BookingSync. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth2 Application ID and Secret
on the [BookingSync Application's Registration Page](https://www.bookingsync.com/en/partners).

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-bookingsync'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::BookingSync` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.1 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :bookingsync, ENV['BOOKINGSYNC_APPLICATION_ID'], ENV['BOOKINGSYNC_SECRET']
end
```

### Authorization for selected account

You can pass the `account_id` parameter to the authorization url to request
authorization for a selected account. For users with multiple accounts,
this will skip the account selection process and show the accept/deny page.

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth BookingSync is tested under 2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, Ruby-head, Ruby Enterprise Edition, JRuby.
